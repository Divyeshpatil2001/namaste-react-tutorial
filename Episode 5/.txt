importing function component from different dir => import comp_name from path  
importing var value name from different dir => import {comp_name} from path

in file if one compoent or value var then we can use export default other wise export namee for multiple export


in react app data layer and ui layer
-when data layer is change ui gets change
-var sync with data and ui layer so we are using for this react hooks state var - usestate
-using usestae when ever data layer(usestate var) react will re-render that component (change ui layer is change ui sync with data layer)

why react is fast?
-react is very good at dom operation (dom manipulation)
